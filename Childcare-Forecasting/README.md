There is concern over mismatch of demand and supply for preschools (see The Big Read: The preschool conundrum â€” why shortage of places persists in some estates despite millions invested).

The Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) has asked your team to forecast the subzone-level demand for preschool services, in particular those providing childcare (18 months to 6 years) programmes, over the next 5 years, to determine where they should prioritize building / relocating preschools. As a planning norm, you may assume each preschool can accommodate up to 100 children.

In addition to the one-off forecast, ECDA staff wants a tool that they can use to make subsequent decisions on a regular basis (e.g.: every time they receive updated population statistics, update newly opened / closed preschools, learn about upcoming BTO sites, etc.). While they do not expect your team to produce a full-fledged product within 2 days, they would like to have some idea of what the eventual tool could look like, as well as how it could be deployed.
